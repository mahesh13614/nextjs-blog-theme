I read recenty somewhere 'We are all alive, but are we living?'
The unexamined life is not worth living said Socrates. If we read the classics from that age the thinkers very acively refer to the role opf philosophers in society in helping guide scoiety on how to think and have an approach to life. 
The actual schools of philosohy might be something we are able to agree or disagree with but the fact that they thought about the very core of the proincliplesof life as something to think about and have a stand on and debate on it and build entire schools ofthought on those philosophies and wite books is impressive.
In today's world, we do not have time for that. The philosophers are nudged to academia and seldom have a hold onthe public heart. 
We run every day.
